		<h4>Trish Millines Dziko</h4>
		<p>She is a software engineer, educator, and the co-founder and executive director of the Seattle-based Technology Access Foundation (TAF). This organization focuses on strengthening mathematical and literacy competencies through project-based learning, providing an environment where technology is used as a powerful tool for education.</p>
		<p>Prior to her work with TAF, she built an extensive career in the high-tech industry as a designer, developer, and manager. Despite her success in tech, her passion has been for children and education. This dedication has earned her dozens of local and national awards for her work in educating children of color.</p>
		<p>What is truly remarkable is that she launched this second career at the age of 39, following her retirement from Microsoft. Her journey is a testament to her passion and drive.</p>
		<p>She believes there is room for her generation to make a meaningful contribution to the next, helping students reach their full potential. Driven by the philosophy that no student should be held back by poverty, she acts as a facilitator, opening doors for students and ensuring they are ready to walk through them. Rather than a traditional educator, she defines herself as a partner who plans alongside each student to help them achieve their goals.</p>

	    <h3>Moses West</h3>
	    <p>As an engineer, Moses developed a water system that takes air and transforms it into fresh water. Every human being has a need for water, and Moses has been working to bring that water to places that need it, seeking to ensure “disenfranchised communities in the united states” have access to clean, fresh water. (see 4:39 in the video below). On his foundation's website, you will find this statement: “Universal access to clean water is a human right” (<i>Our Story</i>, 2023).</p>
        <p>His foundation explains their commitment this way:</p>
        <blockquote cite="https://moseswestfoundation.org/our-story/"><p>The Moses West Foundation operates with a commitment to advancing social, environmental, and economic equity.</p>

<p>We champion sustainable water solutions, aiming to educate and unite organizations towards a collective betterment. Our mission encompasses equipping communities to navigate and surmount contemporary and forthcoming challenges related to water, food, and energy security.</p>

<p>By promoting sustainability and self-sufficiency, we nurture a culture poised for enduring resilience. (<i>Our Story</i>, 2023)</p></blockquote>
<p>Moses was born in Georgia but grew up in Germany as his parents were in the army. He also would later on join the army, and that provided the seed that would later grow into the company he now runs. During his army years, he visited places where water quality was very poor. One article mentions that they had to use iodine to cleanse the water just to get by (<i>GVS Guest Speaker Moses West Turns Air into Water</i>, n.d.).</p>

<p>Where did he get the idea for his technology? Moses had a neighbor who owned a small machine that took air and turned it into water. He took that idea and developed it into a global service, providing water to countries across the globe. (G<i>GVS Guest Speaker Moses West Turns Air into Water</i>, n.d.). You can read how his company provided clean water despite Hurricane Melissa disruption in Jamaica (“This Engineer’s Solar Tech Has Kept Clean Water Flowing After Hurricane Melissa,” 2025).</p>
