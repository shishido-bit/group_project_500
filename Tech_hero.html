	    <h4>Moses West</h4>
	    <p> As an engineer, Moses developed a water system that takes air and transforms it into fresh water. Every human being needs water, and Moses is working to bring that water to places that need it. You can read articles on how his company provided clean water despite Hurricane Melissa disruption in Jamaica. See the links below for more information.</p>

        <p>Moses was born in Georgia but grew up in Germany as his parents were in the army. He also would later on join the army, and that provided the seed that would later grow into the company he now runs. During his army years, he visited places where water quality was very poor. One article mentions that they had to use iodine to cleanse the water just to get by. This experience, the article points out, played a part in inspiring him to improve water quality in areas that desperately need it. On his company's website, they have stated this line:  “Universal access to clean water is a human right.”</p>

<p>As the story goes (see <i>GVS Guest Speaker Moses West Turns Air into Water</i> below), Moses had a neighbor who owned a small machine that took air and turned it into water. He took that idea and developed it into a global service, providing water to countries across the globe. He emphasizes resilience and working for the good of others.</p>

<p>Perhaps you have heard of him, perhaps you have not. He is not the big name you hear about on the news on a regular basis. Perhaps it took a hurricane for him to appear on the news. But what he is doing is important. In a very real sense, water is life. And it is part of his mission to provide that water to communities that need it.</p>
