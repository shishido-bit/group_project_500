			<h4 id="intersectionality">Intersectionality</h4>
			<p>By way of introduction, what follows are a set of definitions revolving around the concept of intersectionality.</p>
<p>According to the Oxford English Dictionary, "The interconnected nature of social categorizations such as race, class, and gender, regarded as creating overlapping and interdependent systems of discrimination or disadvantage; a theoretical approach based on such a premise."</p>

<p>Patricia Hill Collins and Sirma Bilge define Intersectionality as “a way of understanding and analyzing the complexity in the world, in people, and in human experiences. The events and conditions of social and political life and the self can seldom be understood as shaped by one factor. They are generally shaped by many factors in diverse and mutually influencing ways. When it comes to social inequality, people’s lives and the organization of power in a given society are better understood as being shaped not by a single axis of social division, be it race or gender or class, but by many axes that work together and influence each other. Intersectionality as an analytic tool gives people better access to the complexity of the world and of themselves.”</p>

<p>Ben Shapiro defines intersectionality as “a form of identity politics in which the value of your opinion depends on how many victim groups you belong to. At the bottom of the totem pole is the person everybody loves to hate—the straight, white male.”</p>
