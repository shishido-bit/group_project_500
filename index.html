		<h4>The purpose</h4>
		<p>This website aims to help you engage in the discussion on intersectionality and implicit bias. It is designed to push you beyond the familiar and introduce you to concepts you may not have heard before or perhaps have not thought too deeply about. Terms like intersectionality and implicit bias may be challenging for you. We hope the information you find on these pages is useful and allows you to join the conversation in a more informed manner.</p>
		<h4>How to explore this site</h4>
		<p>To navigate your way around, use the four linked tabs just above the title of this page to explore more about the creators of this website, resources available to you on the topic of implicit bias and intersectionality, and tech heroes who have perhaps gone unnoticed in the past.</p>
